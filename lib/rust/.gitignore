# To make development easier, it can be useful to make lib/rust/zephyr/.cargo/config.toml a symlink
# to the build's build/rust/sample-cargo-config.toml file. This will allow the IDE to work for the
# current build and do completion and such in the Zephyr crate.
# However, it is important to not commit this symlink.
