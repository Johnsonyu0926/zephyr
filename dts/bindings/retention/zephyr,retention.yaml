  Retention subsystem area, which has a retained memory parent. Example
  64-byte area with 2-byte prefix and 1-byte checksum with 61 usable bytes
  for user storage:

  sram@2003FFC0 {
    compatible = "zephyr,memory-region", "mmio-sram";
    reg = <0x2003FFC0 64>;
    zephyr,memory-region = "RetainedMem";
    status = "okay";

    retainedmem {
      compatible = "zephyr,retained-ram";
      status = "okay";
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <1>;

      retention0: retention@0 {
        compatible = "zephyr,retention";
        status = "okay";
        reg = <0x0 0x40>;
        prefix = [04 fa];
        checksum = <1>;
      };
    };
  };

compatible: "zephyr,retention"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  "#address-cells":
    const: 1
    description: |
      Address reg cell is for the offset of the area in parent node, can be
      increased if multiple retention partitions are used or parts are
      reserved.

  "#size-cells":
    const: 1
    description: |
      Size reg cell is for the size of the area, which includes sizes of
      prefix and checksum (if enabled).

  reg:
    required: true

  write32:
    description: |
      An optional property to indicates that retention memory requires
      write in 32bit words. With some sram, especially on the stm32h74x/h750 mcus,
      when an incomplete word is written to an retention ram and a reset occurs,
      the last incomplete word is not really written. This is due to the ECC behavior.
      This property must be set to ensure that an incomplete word is written to retention ram,
      It will write an additional dummy incomplete word to the same RAM at a different address
      before issuing a reset.
    type: boolean

  prefix:
    description: |
      An optional magic prefix, which indicates that the data has been set
      (applies to the header of the data, reduces the available user data
      size).
    type: uint8-array

  checksum:
    description: |
      An optional data verification checksum, which indicates that the data is
      valid (appended to the footer of the data, reduces the available user
      data size). Value is size in bytes (0 for none, 1 for 8-bit CRC, 2 for
      16-bit CRC, 4 for 32-bit CRC). Default is to not use a checksum.
    type: int
    default: 0
