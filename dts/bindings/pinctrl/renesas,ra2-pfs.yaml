    description: |
        This property indicates the number of in-use slots of available slots
        for GPIOs. The typical example is something like this: the hardware
        register is 32 bits wide, but only 18 of the bits have a physical
        counterpart. The driver is generally written so that all 32 bits can
        be used, but the IP block is reused in a lot of designs, some using
        all 32 bits, some using 18 and some using 12. In this case, setting
        "ngpios = <18>;" informs the driver that only the first 18 GPIOs, at
        local offset 0 .. 17, are in use.  For cases in which there might be
        holes in the slot range, this value should be the max slot number-1.

  gpio-reserved-ranges:
    type: array
    description: |
        If not all the GPIOs at offsets 0...N-1 are usable for ngpios = <N>,
        then this property contains an additional set of tuples which specify
        which GPIOs are unusable. This property indicates the start and size of
        the GPIOs that can't be used.

        For example, setting "gpio-reserved-ranges = <3 2>, <10 1>;" means that
        GPIO offsets 3, 4, and 10 are not usable, even if ngpios = <18>.
